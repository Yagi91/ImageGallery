## User Stories

- As a user, I would like to view different photos that interest me.
- As a user, I would also like to click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details of the photo. The photo details must appear on a modal within the same route as the main page.
- As a user, I would like to filter for different categories of photos. (ie. Travel, Food)
